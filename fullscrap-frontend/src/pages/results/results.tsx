                Changing the world one line of code at a time ðŸš€. <br />
                <br />
                Since I was a kid I have always been passionate about
                technology, besides being quite curious. I remember seeing
                people close to me using applications that solved many of their
                needs, and constantly wondering about how they work, or how they
                are made. This served as a great motivation for me to choose
                Computer Engineering as a degree at college. <br />
                <br />
                For that reason, I have always been in love with what I was
                studying, but I still couldn't decide what I was going to do for
                a living. This changed when I did my first academic project in
                software development, as I had the oportunity to lead my team
                and participate in the development of a Learning Management
                System (LMS). It was then when I realized the potential we have
                as developers to materialize and turn ideas or initiatives into
                reality that allow us to make a big change in society. <br />
                <br />
                Currently I am a front-end developer with experience in complex
                projects both in the academic and work environment, where I can
                perform adequately thanks to my ability to analyze and solve
                problems, as well as my great orientation to detail. Also, I
                consider myself a highly curious person, which leads me to keep
                learning new technologies. <br />
                <br />I have experience working with React (Hooks), Redux, RxJS,
                HTML, Sass, TypeScript, Git, Scrum y Angular (to a lesser
                extent). In addition, I have knowledge of AWS infrastructure,
                TDD and Selenium. Moreover, I am learning Node.JS, MongoDB,
                Express.JS and GraphQL to complete the MERN stack and become a
                full-stack developer. <br />
                <br />I will gladly recieve your messages, comments or
                suggestions, so feel free to connect on LinkedIn or send me an
                email at rodrigo.dulanto@pucp.edu.pe.{" "}
